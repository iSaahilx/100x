# ChatGPT Voice Bot

A minimal web application that lets anyone talk to ChatGPT through their microphone and hear its answers out loud.

## Demo

Open the deployed site and click **üéôÔ∏è Speak**. Ask things like:

- "What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?"
- "What's your #1 superpower?"

‚Ä¶and the bot will answer in first-person.

# 3. run
